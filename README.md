This was a projet for the IB computer science course. In this case, it consist of a web that shows the current weather and forecast. Moreover, it also calculates based on that data the quality of the sky for astronomical observation. Due to the lack of any formula to calculate that quality I designed one of my own that is quite simple, but also very flawed.

I would be very greatfull for any ideas that are proposed.
